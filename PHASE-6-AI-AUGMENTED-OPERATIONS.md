## üß† AI Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Delegation Engine (IDE)

**Purpose**: Dynamically assigns tasks based on roles, workloads, and skills

**Features**:
- Real-time workload analysis
- Skills matching
- Location-based routing
- Organizational hierarchy consideration

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
const task = {
  type: 'safety_inspection',
  priority: 'high',
  requiredSkills: ['safety', 'inspection'],
  department: 'HSSE',
  location: 'Main Workshop',
  estimatedDuration: 2
};

const recommendation = await mbarieAI.recommendDelegation(task);
```

### 2. Predictive Safety & Risk AI (PSR-AI)

**Purpose**: Analyzes permits and incidents to predict potential hazards

**Features**:
- Historical incident pattern recognition
- Real-time risk scoring
- Mitigation strategy suggestions
- Confidence-based assessments

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
const riskAssessment = await mbarieAI.assessRisk(permitData, incidentHistory);
```

### 3. Document Intelligence (DI)

**Purpose**: Automatically analyzes and summarizes technical documents

**Features**:
- Content summarization
- Category classification
- Compliance assessment
- Actionable insights generation

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
const analysis = await mbarieAI.analyzeDocument(content, 'QA/QC Report');
```

### 4. Permit Orchestration AI (PO-AI)

**Purpose**: Recommends required approvers and identifies missing requirements

**Features**:
- Approval chain optimization
- Missing requirement detection
- Timeline estimation
- Critical path analysis

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
const recommendation = await mbarieAI.recommendPermitApproval(permitData);
```

### 5. Workflow Insight Dashboard (WID)

**Purpose**: Provides real-time operational analytics and recommendations

**Features**:
- Permit completion rates
- Incident trends
- Bottleneck identification
- Predictive analytics

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
const insights = await mbarieAI.generateWorkflowInsights();
```
