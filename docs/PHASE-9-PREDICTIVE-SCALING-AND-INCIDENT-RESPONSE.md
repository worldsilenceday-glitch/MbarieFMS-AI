    branches: [ phase9-predictive-scaling ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *'  # Daily model training

jobs:
  train-models:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run train-predictive-models

    needs: train-models
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm run deploy-phase9
```

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Add required environment variables to Railway
railway variables:set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
railway variables:set NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL=https://...
# ... add all required variables
```

### 2. Database Migrations
```sql
-- Add predictive scaling tables
CREATE TABLE scaling_predictions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  predicted_cpu_usage DECIMAL,
  predicted_ram_usage DECIMAL,
  recommended_replicas INTEGER,
  confidence_score DECIMAL
);

CREATE TABLE incident_logs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  incident_type VARCHAR(100),
  severity VARCHAR(20),
  detected_at TIMESTAMP,
  resolved_at TIMESTAMP,
  root_cause TEXT,
  resolution_actions TEXT
);
```

### 3. Testing Strategy
```bash
# Test predictive scaling
npm run test-predictive-scaling

# Test incident response
npm run test-incident-response

# Test resilience simulation
npm run test-resilience

# Integration tests
npm run test-phase9-integration
```
